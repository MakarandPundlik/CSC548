Description:The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a fundamental graph algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. This classic dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(VÂ³), making it computationally intensive for large graphs. This project explores parallel implementations of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to address these performance limitations.
We implemented and compared three versions of the algorithm:

1. A sequential CPU implementation (baseline)
2. A parallel implementation using OpenMP for CPU multithreading
3. A parallel implementation using CUDA for GPU acceleration
   By parallelizing the algorithm on both multicore CPUs and GPUs, we aim to demonstrate significant performance improvements while maintaining computational correctness. The project evaluates each implementation's execution time across various graph sizes and densities, highlighting the scalability and efficiency benefits of parallel computing approaches.
